# Demand-Paged-Virtual-Memory-Implementation
The project employs a modular C++ architecture to simulate virtual memory management through inter-process communication using System V message queues. Each process reads a sequence of page references and interacts with a scheduler and a Memory Management Unit (MMU) to handle page requests and faults.
